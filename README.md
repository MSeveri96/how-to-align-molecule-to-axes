# How to align a molecule to the cartesian axes
In this repository there is a brief tutorial (mostly for myself, I admit) regarding how to aling a molecule to the cartesian axes. 

## Step 1:

Follow the procedure highlighted here in VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/script_library/scripts/orient/), this will orient correctly the molecule,but the center of mass may not be in the origin

## Step 2:
Move the origin to the center of mass. 

As far as I know this can be done in Gaussview with the command Edit->Reorient
